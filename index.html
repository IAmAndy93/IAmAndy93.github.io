                <h2>Future junior backend software developer</h2>
                <p>I love brain teasers and logic games and puzzles. That is why I think learning programming is perfect for me. I love learning about it and can't wait for my future career.</p>
                <p>The other reason why I decided to change career is this vocation allows one to work from remote location, and it is mine and my wifes dream to move to a seashore somewhere, probably in Croatia.</p>

                <h4>Logic gate</h4>
                <p>It is an idealized or physical device implementing a Boolean function; that is,
                    it performs a logical operation on one or more binary inputs and produces a
                    single binary output.
                </p>
                <h4>ASCII</h4>    
                <p>It stands for American Standard Code for Information Interchange. Computers can
                    only understand numbers, so it is the numerical representation of a character
                    such as 'a' or '@' or an action of some sort.
                </p>
                <h4>RAM</h4>    
                <p>It is a form of computer data storage which stores frequently used program
                    instructions to increase the general speed of a system. It can be randomly
                    accessed. Data items to be read or written in almost the same amount of time
                    irrespective of the physical location of data inside the memory.
                </p>
                <h4>Programming language</h4>
                <p>A formal language that specifies a set of instructions that can be used to
                    produce various kinds of output. They generally consist of instructions for a
                    computer and can be used to create programs that implement specific algorithms.
                </p>
                <h4>DNS or Domain name system</h4>
                <p>A hierarchical decentralized naming system for computers, services, or other
                    resources connected to the Internet or a private network. It associates various
                    information with domain names assigned to each of the participating entities.
                </p>
                <h4>HTTP or Hypertext Transfer Protocol</h4>
                <p>An application protocol for distributed, collaborative, and hypermedia
                    information systems. It is the foundation of data communication for the World
                    Wide Web. It is the standard protocol to exchange or transfer hypertext.
